# Instead of this clever script, we could require CMake 2.24 which
# supports CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES which would enable us to
# use https://github.com/conan-io/cmake-conan.
#
# Not only does that seem slightly more idiomatic but it would
# hopefully allow us to automatically CMake's CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE with
# our profile build type.  But CMake 2.24 is too new for GitHub CI's
# default runners, so we just have to remember to use ONLY Release in
# the CI.  Which, might not be a bad idea anyway.
#
# We'd probably solve the default profile hacking below.
